     Privacy concerns – Facebook has a history of violating user privacy. For example, in 2012, 
    the company proposed an app that would have let marketers track users’ web browsing activity 
    outside of Facebook. This would have allowed them to better target advertisements on Facebook. 
    Two years ago, the company admitted that it had been secretly saving phone numbers and text messages 
    from Android devices for years. More recently, Facebook shut down nearly 200 apps due to privacy concerns.
    Can cause addiction – Facebook can be distracting, rather than being helpful. 
    Instead of checking your Facebook feed and addressing the tasks that need to be done, it can take over your life. 
    It has been proven that Facebook can also have a negative impact on someone’s lifestyle habits. 
    The addiction to Facebook is so severe that some people find themselves logging in as soon as their phone wakes up in,
    checking for notifications before anything else.Can disrupt sleep – It is well known that Facebook can be addicting.
    It also disrupts sleep patterns. One study found that the blue light from smartphones, 
    laptops and other devices that emit this type of light can suppress the production of melatonin.
    This means people are not getting enough sleep or the deep, beneficial sleep that they need to function 
    well and stay healthy.
